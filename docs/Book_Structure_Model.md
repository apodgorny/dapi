## Book Structure Model

This document defines the hierarchical narrative structure of a book, composed of Acts, Scenes, and Beats. It draws from the psychological duality model and introduces beats as micro-events that can represent internal or interpersonal tension, transformation, or decision.

### Hierarchical Structure

**Act**: A large structural unit with a thematic and narrative arc.
- Contains major transitions in character arcs or story stakes.
- Typically composed of several scenes.

**Scene**: A self-contained sequence where something significant happens.
- Has a setting, characters, conflict, and some form of resolution or change.
- May contain internal or external dramatic action.
- Scenes advance the story in visible, structural ways.

**Beat**: The smallest unit of change — a moment of tension, choice, or revelation.
- Often tied to an emotional or psychological micro-shift.
- Multiple beats occur inside a scene.

### Beat as Subpersonality Interaction

Each **beat** can represent not only dialogue or action, but also:
- An internal negotiation or collision between **subpersonalities** within the same character.
- A clash or resonance between the **subpersonalities of different characters**.

For example:
- A character hears a phrase that activates their Yin side (e.g., guilt, avoidance).
- They hesitate — a beat where the Yin tries to suppress the Yang (e.g., assertiveness).
- The character then lashes out — a Yang reactivation beat.

Thus, **beats are micro-interactions between internal sides** of one or more personalities.
They form the invisible architecture of emotional authenticity, even within action or dialogue scenes.

### Examples

#### Act
- "The World As It Was" — setup of ordinary life, unresolved wounds, suppressed dualities.
- "Breaking Equilibrium" — the moment the protagonist must face something that reactivates old trauma.

#### Scene
- Setting: protagonist’s childhood home.
- Conflict: confronted by mother (authority figure from Yin side).
- Outcome: protagonist regresses into submissive patterns.

#### Beats
1. Approaching the door (hesitation — Yang suppressed).
2. Mother opens and speaks harshly (Yin activation).
3. Flashback triggers (trauma memory beat).
4. Attempt to speak up (Yang resurfaces).
5. Breaks into tears (collapse of both sides).

These beats **map onto duality dynamics**, creating layered meaning.

### Integration with Psychological Model

- Each scene can be interpreted as dominated by a certain duality or subpersonality.
- Beats allow tracing the **focus of attention** as it shifts from one pole to another.
- Resolution of duality often requires a beat where **meta-awareness** arises — a third position that integrates both poles.

This model can be used to:
- Generate consistent, emotionally truthful scenes
- Encode the progression of inner transformation
- Reflect trauma-informed character dynamics

It also supports recursive construction:
> First outline acts (themes), then scenes (turning points), then beats (shifts), each with subpersonality signatures.

This forms a bridge between narrative structure and internal psychological architecture of characters.
