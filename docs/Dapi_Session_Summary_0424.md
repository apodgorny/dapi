# ðŸ§  DAPI Session Summary â€” April 24

## âœ… Interpreter Unification

We completed the unification of interpreter interfaces in DAPI. All interpreters â€” `MiniPythonInterpreter`, `FullPythonInterpreter`, and `LLMInterpreter` â€” now share a common interface:

```python
Interpreter(
	operator_name     = str,
	operator_code     = str,
	operator_input    = dict,
	execution_context = ExecutionContext,
	external_callback = Callable,
	config            = dict
)
```

They implement a single async method:

```python
async def invoke(self) -> dict
```

## ðŸ§¼ FullPythonInterpreter Rework

- No longer loads from file
- Assumes `code` and `invoke()` presence is validated at registration
- Uses `FullPython(code, ...)` directly
- Returns `interpreter.result`
- All errors are passed to `DapiException.consume()`

---

## ðŸ§¼ MiniPythonInterpreter Rework

- Same instantiation flow as `FullPythonInterpreter`
- No `call_main()`; execution happens in `__init__`
- `MiniPython(code, ...)` runs and stores result in `.result`
- Uses shared context and external call delegation

---

## ðŸ”§ Interpreter Base Class

Created `Interpreter` abstract base class:

- Stores all common fields (name, code, input, context, call, config)
- Requires implementation of `async def invoke()`
- Ensures full symmetry across interpreter types

---

## ðŸ§  Interpreter Philosophy Recap

From the April recap and today's work:

- **Execution starts in `__init__`** for both `MiniPython` and `FullPython`
- **Trace context (`ExecutionContext`) is passed explicitly** â€” never created internally
- **All external operator calls go through `call_external_operator(...)`**
- **No output transformation is needed** â€” everything is already in dict form

---

## ðŸ§¼ MiniPython Core Redesign

- Old logic based on `call_main()` removed
- Evaluation now handled as part of instantiation
- Code is parsed, entrypoint detected, context pushed
- Execution happens immediately, result saved to `.result`

---

## ðŸ”š Next Steps

- Expand `MiniPython.eval()` to support full AST traversal
- Finalize `LLMInterpreter` with same invocation model
- Test full operator chain end-to-end

---

> **Guiding Principle:** Everything is an operator. Execution is a conversation between interpreters.
