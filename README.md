# dapi
DAPI (Dynamic API) is a minimal, fully self-reflective and self-extensible computation system based on a unified operator-transaction model. It enables runtime creation, invocation, transformation, and deletion of logic and data. It is designed for deep human-AI collaboration and self-replicating architectures.
